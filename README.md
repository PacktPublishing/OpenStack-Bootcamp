# OpenStack Bootcamp
This is the code repository for [OpenStack Bootcamp](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-finance-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787125698), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
OpenStack is developed by a thriving community of individual developers around the globe and is backed by most of the leading players in the cloud space today. OpenStack is a free and open source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). 
This book begins with the design principles of OpenStack and the available OpenStack distributions. You’ll start by getting a fundamental understanding of the core concepts and then move on to a comparison of OpenStack components with real-life examples. Then, we’ll show you the typical architecture of OpenStack clouds, how to configure each OpenStack component, and debugging techniques. 
Later, we focus on the latest releases of OpenStack: Mikata, Newton, and Ocata. You’ll be introduced to identity, image, networking, and the compute service. You’ll also get a complete understanding of how to install, configure, and administrate your entire virtual private cloud. You will also be provided with hands-on exercises to unleash the power of each component in OpenStack. Finally, you’ll see an overview of all the optional projects available under the Openstack umbrella.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 06.

The code will look like the following:
   
        openstack --version
         #Returns the version number for Openstack command-line client.
        openstack service list
         # Will return the list of servers configured as part of the Openstack cluster.
        openstack --help
         #The above command will output the long listing available Openstack CLI.

## Software requirements:
You can benefit greatly by having a system running VirtualBox (or any of its alternatives) and a virtual machine running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The commands and resources discussed in this book are best learned when you can execute them on the test system. Familiarity with the Linux command-line and experience with Linux system administration is expected.
Requirements:
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system
* 6 GB RAM
* 40 GB disk space
* 2 vCPUs
* 2 NIC (Adapter 1 - NAT network and Adapter 2 - host-only network)

### Note:
There are no codes for chapter 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, and 10.
